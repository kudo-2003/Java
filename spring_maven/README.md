# Project Structure
```markdown
The project is organized into the following components:

- **`/src/main/java/`**: Contains the main Java source code for the application.
- **`/src/main/resources/`**: Stores application resources such as configuration files and static assets.
- **`/src/test/java/`**: Holds the Java source code for unit and integration tests.
- **`/src/test/resources/`**: Contains resources required for testing, such as test data or configuration files.
- **`/target/`**: Generated by Maven, this directory includes compiled classes, packaged files, and other build artifacts.
- **`pom.xml`**: The Maven Project Object Model file, which defines project dependencies, plugins, and build configurations.

This structure ensures a clean, modular, and maintainable organization of the project.
